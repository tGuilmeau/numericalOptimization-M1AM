    "- a *problem* part, where all the information and code related to the considered problem (evaluation of $f$, of $\\nabla f$, test for verifying if $x \\in C$,...) are implemented,\n",

    "These functions are respectively called the *zeroth-order*, *first-order* and *second-order* *oracles* of $f$, and are to be implemented in the \"problem part\" of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure has the benefit of being very modular: it is very easy to add a new algorithm, or to solve another problem using algorithms we just implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "During this practical session, `problem1.py`, `problem2.py`, and `problem3.py` will the be the *problem* parts, `algorithms.py` will be the algorithmic part, `session1.ipynb` will be the *main* part, and `utils.py` will contain utilitary functions for plotting."
